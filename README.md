## How to Add a New Song

1. Identify the name of the song.
    * The format should be the primary artist, a dash "`-`", the song title ([in **title case**](https://capitalizemytitle.com/)), and the list of featured artists inside "(Feat. ... )" delimited by spaces.
    * `{artist}` - `{song title}` (Feat. `{featured artist list}`)
    * **Example:** SG Lewis - Impact (Feat. Robyn & Channel Tres)
2. Add the song by using the `add-song.sh` shell script:
    * `./add-song <song name>`
    * **Example:** `./add-song.sh "SG Lewis - Impact (Feat. Robyn & Channel Tres)"`
